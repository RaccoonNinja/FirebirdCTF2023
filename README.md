# Firebird CTF 2023 Write-up(s) by :raccoon::ninja:

- Thank all the problem setters for the wonderful learning experience :D.
- Thank my really strong teammates for carrying me through :adore:, it's an honour to play with such wonderful people.

## Reflections

- My role was mainly supportive and misc, as there are respective teammates for crypto, reverse and web. Again they are GOOD.
- I was definitely lost between challenges and was caught up in the Misc challenges, thinking that I'd have higher chance of solving them. There are some kuyashii aspects.
- I wasn't in good shape and overlooked some very basic RSA stuffs - I gotta start practising crypto again.
- I was completely baffled by BabyMXSS and due to some networking issues couldn't access a core part of Chara Smalltalk Page.
